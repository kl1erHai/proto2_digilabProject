# 🎮 Simon Says - Digital Logic Puzzle Game

A memory-based logic puzzle game built using a **Raspberry Pi**, **Node-RED** and a **Digilab** with LEDs, buttons, an LCD, and an RGB LED.

This project recreates the classic **Simon Says** game, where a sequence of lights is displayed and the player must repeat the pattern by pressing buttons in the correct order. With each success, the sequence grows harder!

## 🧠 Game Logic

1. Press "Start" on the Node-RED dashboard or a physical button.
2. A random LED flashes – that's the first step.
3. Player must press the matching button.
4. If correct:
   - A new LED is added to the sequence.
   - LCD displays new level.
5. If incorrect:
   - RGB flashes red.
   - LCD shows “Wrong! Try Again.”
